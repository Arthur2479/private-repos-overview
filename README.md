## 1. EasyLaw

EasyLaw is a platform that allows legal professionals to manage customs counterfeit goods retention for their clients (brands which legal rights are infringed). It is a desktop application built with PyQT. It generates 3 major types of documents based on the data entered by the legal professionals:


- Formal notices to be sent to opposing parties that imported counterfeit goods (either by post or physically). These are generated as `Word documents`. There are about 80 templates depending on the client, the opposing party's language, the mean of transport of the goods,...
- Analytic and synthetic reports in the form of `Excel documents`. These documents are destined to the clients and are specifically tailored to each client's needs.
- Reports for the customs authorities. These are `Word documents` destined to a specific customs office, with the necessary data to allow them to destroy the counterfeit goods (identifiers, client involved, etc.)

EasyLaw's data is centralised on a server, and thus can be used by multiple legal professionals at once.

Before the development of EasyLaw, the legal professionals had to manually generate the documents and handle all the data during the whole process (which can take multiple weeks). This was a hugely time-consuming, error-prone, and mentally exhausting process. Since the production launch of EasyLaw in January 2024, <u>the legal professionals saved hundreds of hours</u> of repetitive work and can now focus on more complex issues.


### Challenges

As this was my first real software engineering experience, I had to learn a lot of things and faced many challenges. One of them was the <u>generation of Word documents</u>, which can be a real hassle. Another one was the <u>massive amount of data</u> and especially all the details and different possible combinations of the data. Lastly, I learned a lot about <u>developer-client communication</u> and how to <u>understand the expectations of the clients</u>.




It sure was a great experience and I learned a lot from it. Plus the project was a success and the clients are greatly satisfied, so overall a great success!

## 2. Folio

Folio is a platform that allows legal professionals to manage trademark portfolios for their clients. It is a new project that I am currently working on at EasyLaw's clients request.
